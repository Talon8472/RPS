        Game Play Instructions: Rock Paper Scissors is a two player game.
                                Each game can consist of any number of rounds
                                and can result in a win, loss or tie. A game is
                                won by winning the most rounds. Each round
                                consists of one play by each player without the
                                foreknowledge of the other's play. Each play
                                consists of either a rock, paper, or scissors.
                                Rock beats scissors. Paper beats rock. Scissors
                                beats paper.  If each player plays the same move
                                then, a tie is recorded.
